# AnalogTVFilter
**Physically realistic image analog TV filter for Paint.NET**


# About
**AnalogTVFilter** is an image effect plugin for Paint.NET. It makes images look like they are being displayed through an analog TV. The filtering is done in a standards-compliant and physically realistic way, by converting the image to an analog signal, transforming the signal, and interpreting the final signal. Many qualities of real analog video can be reproduced. All 3 major formats (NTSC, PAL and SECAM) are supported. You can toggle interlacing, add noise, add scanline jitter, change filter resonance, crosstalk and bandwidth, add distortion and also look at all valid combinations of the 3 color channels. Experience the nostalgia! (CRT filter not included)
